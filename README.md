# AniWatch
Simple website made with vue.js which fetches basic info about Anime from the Anilist.co GraphQL api

This was my first ever Vue.js project built from scratch without any tutorial. Development has been dropped and no new feature will be added, this repository is only kept up for archiving purposes.
